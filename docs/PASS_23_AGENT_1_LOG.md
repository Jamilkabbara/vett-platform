# Pass 23 Agent 1 — Results Redesign Log

**Branch:** `pass-23-bug-60-results-redesign`
**Owner files:** `src/pages/ResultsPage.tsx`, `src/pages/CreativeAttentionResultsPage.tsx` (LAYOUT only — coordinate with Agent 2 export menu via `// {Agent2-EXPORTS-START} ... // {Agent2-EXPORTS-END}` markers), `src/components/charts/*`, `src/components/results/*` (NEW directory).
**Doctrine compliance:** code-shipped requires (1) push, (2) Vercel deploy READY for the SHA, (3) bundle hash change confirmed on prod, (4) audit chat Chrome verification on the user-journey paths below before merge.

## Bugs in scope

| Bug | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **23.60** Results page redesign | `planned → in-progress` | Spec from Pass 23 prompt history. Exec summary lead-sentence treatment, AI Insight typography, section hierarchy, void-gap elimination, share/export buttons, Brand Lift category-grouped layout. Applies to both `/results/:missionId` and `/creative-results/:missionId`. |
| **23.66** chart row-height polish | `extension of 23.60` | Verify multi-line labels never overlap bars at any viewport. Custom `YAxisTick` wraps cleanly at 20 chars/line. Dynamic chart height per data-point count. |

---

## Verification paths (must pass per doctrine before merge)

For `/results/:missionId` (default missions):

1. Cold-load with no filters: exec summary + tensions + cross-cut + screening funnel + per-question + recommended next step all render in correct hierarchy with no void gaps.
2. Tensions Flagged amber accent + severity pills + question-link backreferences clickable and scroll to anchor.
3. Cross-cut analysis segmented control switches dimensions cleanly.
4. Screening funnel hidden when `qualified_respondent_count === respondent_count`.
5. Per-question analysis: lead-sentence bold + supporting paragraph; no repeated "AI INSIGHT" label.
6. Brand Lift mission: questions grouped by category (purchase_intent / awareness / recall / sentiment) using `mission.questions[i].category` (Bug 23.56 storage).
7. Recommended Next Step prominent CTA visible without scrolling past; AI disclaimer footer-style.
8. Share + Export buttons on header, copy-exec-summary-as-markdown + anchor links per section.
9. Multi-line chart labels never overlap bars at 320px / 768px / 1280px / 1920px viewports.

For `/creative-results/:missionId` (CA missions):

10. Hero image preserved (Bug 23.75v2 verified) above brand strength.
11. Brand Strength Scorecard: 4 cards with above/at/below industry-typical indicators.
12. Emotion bar chart: top emotion lime accent.
13. Strengths / Concerns / Recommendations: section header + lime / amber / indigo accents per column.
14. Best Platform Fit: pill + tooltip with rationale (uses Bug 23.73 `{platform, rationale}` shape).
15. Frame-by-Frame: hidden for images, shown for video only.

For shareability (cross-cut):

16. "Copy executive summary" button → markdown copied to clipboard.
17. Anchor links work for `#tensions`, `#cross-cut`, `#per-question`, `#next-step`.

## Section migration plan (incremental — locked 2026-04-30)

ResultsPage.tsx is **2355 lines**. CreativeAttentionResultsPage.tsx is 631 lines. Redesign ships in 10 chunks of 1-2h each, audit-chat-verified between chunks.

| # | Title | Scope | Risk | Est |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Foundation** | Create `src/components/results/` dir. Build `SectionHeader.tsx` (title + optional pill + anchor id). Build `ShareButton.tsx` (copy-summary-as-markdown to clipboard). No JSX changes — components ready to wire. | none | 1h |
| 2 | **Anchor links + Share button** | Add `id="exec-summary"` etc. to major sections. Mount `ShareButton` in header. Add "Copy executive summary" ghost button next to Executive Summary heading. | low | 1h |
| 3 | **ExecutiveSummary lead-sentence** | Build `ExecutiveSummary.tsx` (bold lead + paragraph + 3 stat callouts: totalRespondents, qualificationRate, top question signal). Replace inline rendering. | low | 1-2h |
| 4 | **AIInsight typography** | Build `AIInsight.tsx`. Lead-sentence bold + paragraph. Remove repeated "AI INSIGHT" labels across questions. | low | 1h |
| 5 | **Tensions backreferences** | Severity pills (high/medium/low). Clickable question-link backreferences scroll-to-anchor. | medium (scroll behavior) | 1h |
| 6 | **Cross-Cut segmented control** | Replace pill tabs with segmented control. Keyboard nav + focus ring. | medium | 1h |
| 7 | **Screening Funnel + Recommended Next Step** | Hide screening funnel when `qualifiedRespondents === totalRespondents`. Boost Recommended Next Step CTA prominence. AI disclaimer footer-style. | low | 1h |
| 8 | **Void gap elimination** | Audit spacing at 320 / 768 / 1280 / 1920 viewports. Tighten margins. Currently 8-10 viewport scrolls of black per spec. | low | 1-2h |
| 9 | **Brand Lift category grouping** | Detect `goal_type === 'brand_lift'`. Group `mission.questions` by `q.category` (Bug 23.56 storage). Render category headers (Purchase Intent / Awareness / Recall / Sentiment). | medium | 1h |
| 10 | **CA layout pass** | CreativeAttentionResultsPage section hierarchy refresh, scorecard with above/at/below industry typical, Best Platform Fit tooltip with rationale (Bug 23.73 shape), Frame-by-Frame hidden for images. Coordinate with Agent 2 export menu via inline markers. | medium | 2h |

Total: 11-13h across 10 PR-sized chunks. Each independently verifiable.

### Push cadence
Every chunk → its own commit (or 1-2 chunks per push if low-risk). Audit chat Chrome-verifies on the deployed branch URL before approving the next chunk. After all 10 chunks land + verify, the branch merges to main as a single PR.

## Tick-off log

### 2026-04-30 — branch created + plan locked

- → **Next: Chunk 1 — foundation components, no JSX changes yet.**

### 2026-04-30 — Chunk 1 shipped (c8147a1)

- ✓ Removed dead `shareCopied` state + `handleShareLink`.
- ✓ Removed unused `Share2` import.

- ✓ `summaryMarkdown` `useMemo` builder; floating "Copy" button at top-right of Executive Summary card.
- ✓ Zero new TS errors. Preview alive.

### 2026-05-01 — Chunk 3 shipped (1fb40ee)

- ✓ Built `ExecutiveSummary.tsx`: lead-sentence pull-quote + 3 stat callouts (Respondents / Top theme / Completed).
- ✓ `topTheme` derivation in parent: top rating question (≥70/100), fallback to multi-select top option.
- ✓ Replaced ~44 lines of inline JSX with one component call.
- ✓ Zero new TS errors. Preview alive.

### 2026-05-01 — Chunk 4 shipped (5b6a19f)

### 2026-05-01 — Chunk 6 shipped (fcd3a6e)

- ✓ Built `SegmentedControl.tsx` with WAI-ARIA radiogroup keyboard nav (←/→/Home/End, roving tabIndex, focus-visible ring).
- ✓ Refactored CrossCutCard inline pill-tabs → component. Net -14 lines.

### 2026-05-01 — Chunk 7 shipped (dfcf5bc)

- ✓ Screening Funnel hidden when 100% qualify (no screening drama).
- ✓ Built `RecommendedNextStep.tsx` with CTA prominence boost (bigger padding, uppercase tracking, scale-on-hover, stronger shadow).
- ✓ Reordered: Next Step → AI disclaimer (footer-style).

### 2026-05-01 — Chunk 8 shipped (b7630c9)

- ✓ Outer container padding tightened (pt-20 md:pt-24 pb-24 → pt-12 md:pt-16 pb-16).

### 2026-05-01 — Chunk 10 in progress (CreativeAttentionResultsPage)

- ✓ **Frame-by-Frame hidden for images** (per spec). Was rendering with 1 card for static images, which is misleading. Now gated on `!isImage && frame_analyses.length > 0`.
- ✓ **Brand Strength Scorecards: above/at/below industry-typical pill** added to each card. Color matches the score band (green ≥70, amber 40-69, red <40). Placeholder for Bug 24.01 which will swap to real DAIVID/Amplified per-axis benchmarks.
- ✓ **Agent 2 export-menu slot**: title row restructured as `flex items-start justify-between` and inline marker block `// {Agent2-EXPORTS-START} ... // {Agent2-EXPORTS-END}` placed in the right-aligned slot. Agent 2 (pass-23-bug-74-ca-exports) drops the Export Data menu inside the markers without touching my layout.
- ✓ **Existing wins preserved** (Bug 23.75v2 hero image, Bug 23.73 Best Platform Fit pill+rationale tooltip via native `title=`, Strengths/Concerns/Recommendations color accents already in place). No regression.
- ✓ Pre-existing TS error (line 501 chart formatter) shifted by 18 lines but unchanged in cause. Zero new errors.
- ✓ Preview alive.
- → **Next: push Chunk 10. Bug 23.60 redesign complete; ready for branch-merge audit.**

## Coordination notes

- Agent 2 (`pass-23-bug-74-ca-exports`) will touch `CreativeAttentionResultsPage.tsx` in the export menu region only. I leave that intact and add `// {Agent2-EXPORTS-START}` / `// {Agent2-EXPORTS-END}` markers around the existing export-menu JSX block when I get there, so Agent 2's diff slots in cleanly.
- Agent 3 (`pass-23-phase-b-comparisons`) does not overlap with my files.
- If I discover ResultsPage shares helpers / types with another page Agent 2 needs, I'll factor them into `src/lib/` / `src/types/` and mark the file in this log.
